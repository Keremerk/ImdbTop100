# ImdbTop100
 
This project is a simple implementation of the IMDB Top 100 Movies API using Retrofit and RecyclerView.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have Retrofit dependencies added to your project. You can add these dependencies to your project by following this [Retrofit link](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and pasting the lines to your app's build.gradle file:

# Usage
The project uses Retrofit to make a GET request to the IMDB Top 100 Movies API and retrieve the movie data. The data is then displayed in a RecyclerView using a custom adapter.

To use this project, simply clone or download this repository, and open it in Android Studio. Run the project and you should see a list of the top 100 movies from IMDB.

# Contributing
If you find any issues with the code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome any contributions and feedback on how to improve the project.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the RapidAPI community for providing the IMDB Top 100 Movies API, and the Retrofit library for making it easy to integrate the API into this project.
